## 3. Engineering and Manufacturing Requirements

### 3.1 Alignment and Center-of-Gravity Constraints
- The center of the **Top Receptacle** and the center of the **Hanging Receptacle** must lie on the same vertical axis.
- This axis must pass through the center of the **front 2 × 2 baseplate** to optimize center-of-gravity behavior and reduce tipping risk.

### 3.2 Assembly Strategy
- Acceptable implementations:
  - **Single-piece print**
  - **Vertically split two-piece construction**
- If split construction is used, mating surfaces must preserve nominal geometry and alignment requirements.

### 3.3 Tolerance Specification
- **General dimensional tolerance:** ±0.5 mm
- Applies to all fit-critical surfaces, interface edges, and receptacle boundaries.

### 3.4 Retention Features
- Integrated pockets for Gridfinity-compatible magnets.
- Pocket sizing and depth must prevent loose seating while allowing practical insertion during assembly.

### 3.5 Material and Process Notes
- Preferred print material: **PETG+** for lightweight receptacle use.
- Alternate fabrication route: **Aluminum CNC** when higher stiffness or production repeatability is required.

## 4. Test Case Scenarios (Physical Validation)

### 4.1 TC-01: Critical Dimensional Verification
**Purpose:** Confirm printed part remains within tolerance on major dimensions.

- **Inputs/Tools:** Calipers, angle gauge
- **Steps:**
  1. Measure overall height, footprint width/depth, base height.
  2. Verify 45° hanging receptacle angle.
  3. Record deviation from nominal.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All measured values within ±0.5 mm (except angle tolerance as defined by measurement capability).

### 4.2 TC-02: Interface Fitment (Gridfinity Modules)
**Purpose:** Validate receptacle interoperability and insertion usability.

- **Inputs/Tools:** Known-good Gridfinity modules (2×2×1 and 2×1×1)
- **Steps:**
  1. Insert modules into base, hanging, and top receptacles.
  2. Confirm no excessive force is required.
  3. Check seated position and removal behavior.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Modules fully seat, remain retained in expected orientation, and can be removed without binding.

### 4.3 TC-03: Static Load Capacity
**Purpose:** Confirm payload capacity and structural integrity.

- **Inputs/Tools:** Incremental weights up to 200 g
- **Steps:**
  1. Apply staged load (e.g., 50 g increments) up to 200 g.
  2. Hold at maximum load for 10–30 minutes.
  3. Inspect for permanent deformation or crack initiation.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** No structural failure, no permanent deformation affecting intended function.

### 4.4 TC-04: Stability and Tip Resistance
**Purpose:** Verify center-of-gravity behavior under realistic loading.

- **Inputs/Tools:** Typical module payload distribution
- **Steps:**
  1. Populate base, hanging, and top receptacles with representative items.
  2. Place on flat surface and apply light handling disturbances.
  3. Observe rocking, drift, or tipping tendencies.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** No tipping in nominal use conditions; acceptable stability during light interaction.

### 4.5 TC-05: Magnet Pocket Retention
**Purpose:** Validate magnet pocket function.

- **Inputs/Tools:** Specified magnet size set
- **Steps:**
  1. Insert magnets in all retention pockets.
  2. Check flushness and frictional retention.
  3. Perform light pull and handling checks.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Magnets seat consistently and remain retained under normal handling.

### 4.6 TC-06: Assembly Variant Validation (If Two-Piece Build Used)
**Purpose:** Ensure split build option remains dimensionally equivalent and mechanically sound.

- **Inputs/Tools:** Printed split components, assembly hardware/adhesive per build plan
- **Steps:**
  1. Assemble split components.
  2. Re-run TC-01 and TC-02 checks on assembled part.
  3. Inspect seam alignment and rigidity.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Assembled unit meets dimensional and fitment requirements without seam-induced misalignment.

## 5. Artifact and Test-Data Folder Structure (3 Alternatives)

The project needs to support:
- preprint assets (render source and previews)
- slicer files
- real test prints
- output photos/renders
- test results stored with the same print revision folder
- online testing that produces render outputs only

Below are three workable layouts.

### 5.1 Alternative A — Revision-Centric (Recommended)
Store everything per print revision in one subfolder so each print is fully self-contained.

```text
output/
  prints/
    print-YYYYMMDD-r01/
      preprint/
        model.stl
        slicer.3mf
        online-renders/
          iso.png
          side.png
      test-print/
        photos/
          front.jpg
          side.jpg
        results/
          checklist.md
          measurements.csv
          pass-fail.json
```

**Why use it:**
- Easiest traceability: one folder = one revision + all evidence.
- Best match for your requirement that specific print folders capture print results.
- Online outputs remain inside `preprint/online-renders/` only.

### 5.2 Alternative B — Pipeline-Stage-Centric
Separate by workflow stage, then version each print revision under every stage.

```text
output/
  preprint/
    print-YYYYMMDD-r01/
      stl/model.stl
      slicer/slicer.3mf
      online-renders/
        iso.png
  test-prints/
    print-YYYYMMDD-r01/
      photos/
        front.jpg
      results/
        checklist.md
        measurements.csv
  final-renders/
    print-YYYYMMDD-r01/
      hero.png
```

**Why use it:**
- Clear process flow (preprint -> print -> final render).
- Good if different people/tools own different stages.

**Tradeoff:**
- Evidence for one revision is split across multiple roots.

### 5.3 Alternative C — Manifest-Driven Hybrid
Keep files physically grouped by type, but use a per-revision manifest to link all artifacts and test outcomes.

```text
output/
  artifacts/
    preprint/
      print-YYYYMMDD-r01/
        model.stl
        slicer.3mf
    online-renders/
      print-YYYYMMDD-r01/
        iso.png
    print-photos/
      print-YYYYMMDD-r01/
        front.jpg
  validation/
    print-YYYYMMDD-r01/
      checklist.md
      measurements.csv
      results.json
      manifest.yaml
```

Example `manifest.yaml` fields:
- revision_id
- model_file
- slicer_file
- online_render_files
- print_photo_files
- test_results_file
- overall_status

**Why use it:**
- Scales best for automation/reporting dashboards.
- Strong for machine-readable indexing across many revisions.

### 5.4 Naming and Result-Capture Conventions (Applies to Any Alternative)
- Use immutable revision IDs, e.g. `print-20260211-r03`.
- Keep a `results/` (or `validation/`) folder for each print revision.
- Minimum result files per revision:
  - `checklist.md` (human notes)
  - `measurements.csv` (raw dimensional/load observations)
  - `pass-fail.json` (structured verdict by test case)
- Keep online render outputs isolated to an `online-renders/` folder to reflect that online testing only generates renders.

### 5.5 Suggested Choice
Choose **Alternative A (Revision-Centric)** unless you already run an automated data pipeline. It is the simplest way to keep model, slicer, print photos, and test results together in the exact same print subfolder.
