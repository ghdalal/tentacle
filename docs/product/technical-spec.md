# Tentacle Technical Specification

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Objective
Design a compact Gridfinity-compatible vertical organizer that supports a mixed loading pattern (front, angled-hanging, and top modules) while maintaining stability and printability.

### 1.2 Standards and Basis
- Grid System: Gridfinity standard
- Pitch: 42 mm per grid unit

### 1.3 Envelope and Capacity Requirements
- Total Height: 179.75 mm (25U)
- Total Footprint: 84 mm x 126 mm (2 x 3 Gridfinity units)
- Maximum Supported Payload: 200 g total applied load

### 1.4 Intended Build Approaches
- PETG+ additive manufacturing for lightweight usage
- Aluminum CNC (or equivalent rigid fabrication) for high-stability builds

## 2. Geometric Dimensions and Architecture

### 2.1 Base Section
- Depth: 126 mm (full base length)
- Height: 21.00 mm (equivalent to standard 3U vertical bin height)
- Planform Coverage: 2 x 3 Gridfinity unit footprint

### 2.2 Primary Structural Chassis (Spine)
- Structure Type: Robust C-frame / spine profile
- Anchor Zone: Rear-most 42 mm (1 unit) of the base
- Function: Carry vertical and off-axis loads generated by hanging and top receptacles

### 2.3 Receptacle Interface Geometry

#### 2.3.1 Base Receptacle
- Configuration: Integrated 2 x 2 x 1 Gridfinity
- Access: Front-loaded

#### 2.3.2 Hanging Receptacle
- Configuration: 2 x 2 x 1 Gridfinity
- Orientation: 45 deg from horizontal plane
- Use Case: Angled access while preserving front clearance

#### 2.3.3 Top Receptacle
- Configuration: 2 x 1 x 1 Gridfinity modular space
- Use Case: Small lightweight modules and quick-access items

## 3. Engineering and Manufacturing Requirements

### 3.1 Alignment and Center-of-Gravity Constraints
- The center of the Top Receptacle and the center of the Hanging Receptacle must lie on the same vertical axis.
- This axis must pass through the center of the front 2 x 2 baseplate to optimize center-of-gravity behavior and reduce tipping risk.

### 3.2 Tolerance Specification
- General dimensional tolerance: +/-0.5 mm
- Applies to all fit-critical surfaces, interface edges, and receptacle boundaries.

### 3.3 Retention Features
- Integrated pockets for Gridfinity-compatible magnets.
- Pocket sizing and depth must prevent loose seating while allowing practical insertion during assembly.
- Magnet specification: 6 mm x 2 mm, minimum N35 grade, with a pull force of 2.5 N per pair.
