# Fabrication Guidance

This document outlines fabrication options for Tentacle variants.

## Additive Manufacturing (PETG+)
- Recommended for lightweight usage and rapid iteration.
- Use profiles that preserve dimensional accuracy and avoid warping.
- Validate fit with Gridfinity modules after printing.

## CNC / Rigid Fabrication (Aluminum or Equivalent)
- Recommended for high-stability builds.
- Maintain tight tolerances on fit-critical surfaces and receptacle boundaries.
- Deburr and finish edges to preserve module fit and handling safety.
