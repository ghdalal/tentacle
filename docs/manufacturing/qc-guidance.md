# QC Guidance

Quality checks validate that an artifact matches the published specification and is safe to use.

## Methodology
- Use the test specifications under `docs/product/` as the baseline for checks.
- Record evidence artifacts under `output/prints/<revision>/tests/` as required by scope.
- Checklists are maintained per release under `output/prints/`.

## Scope
- Physical revisions require photographic evidence and a physical test results file.
- Online revisions require digital validation evidence only.

## Notes
- Do not edit or replace files under `output/prints/` after publication.
- Any corrective change requires a new revision.
